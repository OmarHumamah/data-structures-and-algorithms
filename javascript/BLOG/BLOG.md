# Insertion Sort

- Review the pseudocode below, then trace the algorithm by stepping through the process with the provided sample array. Document your explanation by creating a blog article that shows the step-by-step output after each iteration through some sort of visual.

    - the smallest number in the array well move to the the first index.
  - ![](wb2.png)
    - the temp is 8 so it is smaller than the rest of the array's numbers, it will not be swapped.
  - ![](wb3.png)
    - search for other number smaller than the rest if the array's numbers and swap it after the last temp index
  - ![](wb4.png)
    - search for other number smaller than the rest if the array's numbers and swap it after the last temp index
  - ![](wb5.png)
    - the array is sorted from the smallest to the biggest number
  - big(O)
    - time: O(n^2)
    - space: O(1)
